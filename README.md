# File Watch Service Project

The File Watch Service is a simple library that helps you watch a file or directory for change
events. Appropriate callbacks can be received when a file is modified or deleted, and
new files are added into the directory being watched, etc.

It is an ongoing project. Please feel free to contribute to this Project and make it even better.

## How to build

You require the following to build the File Watch Service:

* Latest stable [Oracle JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/)
* Latest stable [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/)

Note that this is build-time requirement.  JDK 6 is enough to run your File Watch Service based application.
